# HR Data Analysis Dashboard
# 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on HR Analytics to understand workforce patterns and optimize decision-making. The analysis explores employee hiring, termination, gender distribution, job positions, education levels, and trends over time using an interactive dashboard.

The primary objective is to help HR teams identify workforce trends, improve hiring strategies, and reduce attrition.

# 🏢 Business Problem
